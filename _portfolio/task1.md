<div style="text-align: justify">The main objective of this task is to detect the location of every character and then recognise it given an input image, which is similar to all the previous RRC scene text detection tasks. The input modal of this task is strictly constrained to image only, no other form of input is allowed to aid the model in the process of detecting and recognising the characters. Vocabulary lists will not be provided as a reference for this challenge.</div>
